* Toki Pona Lesson 1: A few words in basic sentences
+ Here are some words and their meanings.

| *word* | *meaning*                        |
| mi     | I, me, us                        |
| sina   | you                              |
| ona    | he, she, they, it                |  <- Note: Toki Pona has one pronoun, for all genders.
| li     | (between subj. and verb/adj.)    |  
| pona   | good, simple, to improve, to fix |
| ike    | bad, evil, complex, unnecessary  |
| suli   | big, great, important, to grow   |
| lili   | small, few, young, to shrink     |
| kili   | fruit, vegetable, mushroom       |

+ Toki Pona follows the basic sentence structure of:
  [noun] li [adjective /or/ noun]
  corresponding to the English:

+ Eg.
  + ona li suli  :: They/{he, she, it} are big/great/important
  + kili li pona :: Fruit/vegetables/mushrooms are good.
+ An exception to this rule is made when he subject is mi, or sina.
  + sina suli, instead of sina /li/ suli
*** Exercises
+ Animals are important :: soweli li suli
+ He is little :: ona li lili
+ I am great   :: mi suli
+ It is a dog  :: ona li soweli
+ You are bad  :: sina ike

* Toki Pona 2: Introducing the Adjective
New Vocabulary for this lesson:

| *word*  | *meaning*                           |
| ala     | no, not, zero                       |
| ale/ali | all, everything, universe           |
| utala   | fight, battle, challenge            |
| wawa    | strong, powerful                    |
| suwi    | sweet, cute, adorable               |
| jan     | person, people, humanity            |
| mama    | parent, ancestor, creator, origin   |
| meli    | girl, woman, female, feminine, wife |
| mije    | boy, man, male, masculine, husband  |
| moku    | food, to eat                        |

+ In Toki Pona, adjectives are /post-modifying/, not /pre-modifying/ (like English).
  For example:
  + jan wawa  :: strong person
  + mije suwi :: cute boy

+ Oftentimes, nouns can double as adjectives. Pronouns, such as mi, sina, ona, can be possessive:
  + mama mi :: my parent
  + soweli sina :: your animal
  + moku ona    :: their food
+ Adjectives can function as nouns:
  + wawa sina :: your strength
  + suli ona  :: their size/greatness

*** Of note: the phrase “jan pona”, which literally means “good person”, but is widely (and officially) accepted to also mean “friend".
  
+ Multiple adjectives can be used:
  + soweli lili swui :: cute pet (cute little animal)
  + mama mi li pona  :: My parents are good.
  + kili suwu li moku pona :: sweet fruits are good food
  + jan lili mi li suwi :: My children are cute.

*** Note: It is worth noting that the particle “li” is only removed if the subject is just the word “mi” or “sina”.
  If it has any adjectives added to it, then the particle is used.
*** /Tonsi/ (derived from chinese /tongzhi/ - comrade) is used by some to refer to non-binary, genderqueer and trans individuals.

** Exercises 
*** Now, try to figure out the meaning of these sentences.

+ meli mi li pona.      :: my wife is good
+ mije sina li suli.    :: your husband is important
+ mama mije mi li wawa. :: my father is strong
+ soweli ale li pona.   :: all animals are good
+ kili li moku suli.    :: fruit is important food
  
*** And try to translate the following sentences into toki pona.

+ My wife is adorable.  :: meli mi li suwi
+ All warriors are bad. :: jan utala ale li ike
+ My friends are your friends. :: jan pona mi jan pona sina
+ Your son is strong. :: jan lile mije sina li wawa
+ The small fruit is sweet. :: kili lili li suwi

  * Verbs have no tense.
